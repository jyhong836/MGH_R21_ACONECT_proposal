# Purpose and Study Description: Training an Artificial Intelligence Chatbot on I-CONECT Conversations

This study will develop an AI chatbot that can act as a interviewer in conversational intervention for socially isolated older adults with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) or Normal Cognition (NC). We will use the recorded conversations (between study staff/interviewer and participants) collected in the prior I-CONECT clinical trial for training.
The training aims to improve the chatbot's ability to follow the I-CONECT protocol (guiding participants to conduct reminiscence, vocabulary enhancement, critical thinking), sustain multi-turn conversations, and avoid unsafe or inappropriate outputs.
This work will be conducted through collaboration between the AI development team (Dr. Junyuan Hong) and investigators (Dr. Hiroko H. Dodge, Dr. Liu Chen) from the I-CONECT research team who provide clinical insights.

Research questions include: 
(1) can archived I-CONECT conversations be used to train a chatbot to deliver protocol-consistent conversational intervention; 
(2) can the model achieve reliable safety and protocol compliance in offline testing; 
(3) which conversation patterns from prior interviewer-participant interactions are most useful for model improvement.

Method:
(1) Curate and preprocess archived I-CONECT audio and video into high-quality, de-identified transcripts that preserve key MCI and protocol-adherence features.
(2) Analyze these transcripts and metadata to characterize interviewer–participant conversation patterns that support engagement and protocol-consistent delivery.
(3) Train and refine AI models on the processed data so the chatbot can simulate interviewer and participant behavior, generate simulated conversations, and be evaluated offline for protocol compliance and safety behavior.

Data Collection: Training data for AI will be obtained from an existing I-CONECT research dataset. New data, simulated conversations and model parameters, will be collected manually in the computer environment. No new conversations or data will be collected from human participants.

Contributions: If successful, this project will provide preliminary support for using AI among socially isolated older adults with Mild Cognitive Impairment or Normal Cognition. The outcomes can further inform broader methods for development of conversational AI systems that must follow structured communication protocols in health-related research environments.

## How recorded conversations will be used to achieve the aim

Recorded I-CONECT conversations are between human interviewers and older adult participants with MCI or NC.
(1) We will use the multimodality data to improve transcription quality for better AI model training.
(2) We will analyze the conversations to identify important patterns for engaging participants.
(3) We will use the conversations to train AI models for participant simulation. The trained AI models will generate simulated conversations for offline testing.
(4) Through simulation, we will evaluate and refine the AI chatbot's protocol compliance and behaviors.


## Details about AI model being developed

The study develops an early-stage AI-based chatbot for conversational intervention. The system is a research prototype for algorithm development, not a finalized clinical product.
In the study, we only develop the AI system and only perform data analysis of I-CONECT data for training the models and explore potential use in conversational intervention.
The AI model be validated/evaluated only in virtual simulation (conversations between chatbot and simulated participants) instead of testing with real participants.
In virtual simulation, the chatbot will be evaluated on its ability and reliability to follow the I-CONECT protocol, sustain multi-turn conversations, and avoid unsafe or inappropriate outputs.
The downstream intended use of the AI chatbot is to execute I-CONECT protocol automaically for preventing dementia early among socially isolated older adults with Mild Cognitive Impairment or Normal Cognition.
