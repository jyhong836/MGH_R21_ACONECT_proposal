\section{Study Population Characteristics}

\textbf{Inclusion of Individuals Across the Lifespan}

% TODO - Check below requirement and write the section.
%  Content:
%     Discuss each of the points listed below. Also include any additional information requested in the
%     NOFO.
%     You will also have to complete an Inclusion Enrollment Report (IER). Note that you may need to
%     include multiple IERs for each study. Refer to the instructions for the IER below for more
%     information.
% Inclusion of Individuals Across the Lifespan:
%     For the purposes of the Inclusion of Individuals Across the Lifespan, exclusion of any specific age
%     or age range group (e.g., children or older adults) should be justified in this section. In addition,
%     address the following points:
%     l Individuals of all ages are expected to be included in all NIH-defined clinical research
%     unless there are scientific or ethical reasons not to include them. Discuss whether
%     individuals will be excluded based on age and provide a rationale for the minimum and
%     maximum age of study participants, if applicable. Additionally, if individuals will be
%     excluded based on age, provide a scientific or ethical rationale for their exclusion. See the
%     NIH Policy and Guidelines on the Inclusion of Individuals Across the Lifespan as
%     Participants in Research Involving Human Subjects for additional information about
%     circumstances that may justify the exclusion of individuals based on age.
%     l Include a description of the expertise of the investigative team for working with
%     individuals of the ages included, the appropriateness of the available facilities to
%     accommodate individuals in the included age range, and how the age distribution of
%     participants will contribute to a meaningful analysis relative to the purpose of the study.
%     When children are involved in research, the policies under HHS’ 45 CFR 46, Subpart D - Additional
%     Protections for Children Involved as Subjects in Research apply and must be addressed in the
%     Protection of Human Subjects attachment.
% Existing Datasets or Resources. If you will use an existing dataset, resource, or samples that may
%     have been collected as part of a different study, you must address   inclusion, following the
%     instructions above. Generally, you must provide details about the sex, race, and ethnicity of the
%     existing dataset/resource and justify the details as appropriate to the scientific goals of the
%     proposed study.


\textbf{Inclusion of Women and Members of Racial and / or Ethnic Minority Groups}
% TODO - Check below requirement and write the section.
% Discuss each of the points listed below and include any additional information requested in the
% NOFO.
% You will also have to complete an Inclusion Enrollment Report (IER). Note that you may need to
% include multiple IERs for each study. Refer to the instructions for the IER below for more
% information.
% Inclusion of Women and Members of Racial and / or Ethnic Minority Groups
% Address the following points:
% l Describe the planned distribution of subjects by sex, race, and ethnicity.
% l Describe the rationale for selection of sex, racial, and ethnic group members in terms of
% the scientific objectives and proposed study design. The description may include, but is
% not limited to, information on the population characteristics of the disease or condition
% under study.
% l Describe proposed outreach programs for recruiting sex, racial, and ethnic group
% members.
% l Inclusion and Excluded Groups: Provide a reason for limiting inclusion of any group by
% sex, race, and/or ethnicity. In general, the cost of recruiting certain groups and/or
% geographic location alone are not acceptable reasons for exclusion of particular groups.
% See the Inclusion of Women and Members of Racial and/or Ethnic Minority Groups in
% Clinical Research for more information.
% Existing Datasets or Resources. If you will use an existing dataset, resource, or samples that may
% have been collected as part of a different study, you must address inclusion, following the
% instructions above. Generally, you must provide details about the sex, race, and ethnicity of the
% existing dataset/resource and justify the details as appropriate to the scientific goals of the
% proposed study

\textbf{Recruitment and Retention Plan}

% TODO - Check below requirement and write the section.
% Describe how you will recruit and retain participants in your study. You should address both
% planned recruitment activities as well as proposed engagement strategies for retention.

\textbf{Study Timeline}

% TODO - Check below requirement and write the section. Note our study is 2-year.
% Provide a description or diagram describing the study timeline. The timeline should be general
% (e.g., "one year after notice of award"), and should not include specific dates.
% Note: Additional milestones or timelines may be requested as just-in-time information or post-award.
