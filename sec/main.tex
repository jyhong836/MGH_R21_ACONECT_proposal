\textbf{Specific Aims}

\textbf{Significance}. Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD)
remain a major and growing public health burden, and the disease's
multifactorial biology continues to outpace the impact of available
therapies\cite{zhang2024recent}. Current U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved
symptomatic treatments offer modest benefits, while newer disease-modifying anti-amyloid immunotherapies are
limited to biomarker-confirmed early Alzheimer's disease and are
accompanied by restricted patient eligibility and significant treatment
burden with cost-effectiveness concerns\cite{mangalagiu2025pharmacological}. 
Thus, it is important to develop accessible and affordable prevention strategies early in the disease course.

\textbf{Critical Barriers.} Social isolation is a recognized, modifiable
risk factor for cognitive decline and dementia in older adults
\cite{evans2019social,kallianpur2023weak,nasem2020social,penninkilampi2018association,poey2017social,shen2022associations}, effective interventions that can deliver sustained, high-fidelity social engagement at the population scale remain limited.
The recent clinical trial (I-CONECT; NCT02871921) proved that
semi-structured conversational engagement with cognitive stimulation can mitigate social isolation and cognitive decline among socially isolated older adults with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI)\cite{dodge2024internet}. Yet, \textit{human-delivered intervention is constrained by workforce availability and high cost}, rendering a persistent barrier to broad dissemination.
Facing the challenge, conversational AI emerges with the potential to provide scalable conversational engagement, but most existing AI systems \comm{like chatgpt, cite} has not encode the essential scientific methods for dementia prevention. 
In our preliminary study\cite{hong2024aconect}, we showed that Large Language Models (LLMs) can be customized to approximately follow the I-CONECT protocol in simulated textual conversations. 
However, the system was still under-optimized for engaging older adults: (i) The single-modality conversation has limited interactivity and thereby low engagement compared to human-led ones; (ii) Older adults faces technical barriers to operate computers to use the AI; 
(iii) The compliance to the protocols, consisting of I-CONECT intervention and safety rules, relies on loose prompt engineering that is neither optimal nor validated at deployment, resulting in concerns in the reliability and safety of the AI-based intervention.
% (iii) The protocol compliance and safety of AI for older adults is unknown, which may lead to concerns in use.
(iv) The system was not evaluated among the targeted population, so the feasibility of AI-based intervention is doubtful. 

\textbf{Solutions.} To enhance the accessibility and affordability of
the I-CONECT intervention, we propose to develop an Conversational AI with Multimodal Interaction (AIMI-CONECT) by leveraging advanced
Generative AI to simulate the human-delivered conversational engagement (I-CONECT). 
% Following the I-CONECT intervention, the AI chatbot will
% provide similar conversation strategies to engage participants and stimulate their cognitive functions. 
% The chatbot will be installed with an multi-modality interface that minimizes the gap to human interactions by using real-time voice input/output and visual emotion responses.
To address the limitations in our preliminary study\cite{hong2024aconect}, our specific aims are:

\textbf{Aim 1: Develop a user-friendly conversational AI with multi-modality interaction (AIMI-CONECT) for executing the I-CONECT intervention.} 
We will use an agentic AI system driven by an LLM to follow the I-CONECT protocol.
% : execute semi-structured conversations, engage participants in reminiscence and vocabulary enhancement. 
(i) \textbf{Multi-modality interaction} augments user engagement by human-AI collaborative recreation and exploration of 3D reminiscence scene, voice chat and visual affective responses\cite{zhao2025transferring}.
Novel machine learning algorithms will be used to optimize the language engagement of LLMs on I-CONECT conversations.
(ii) \textbf{Usability}: To reduce the use barrier for older adults, we will integrate real-time and responsive audio interface without typing or frequent button presses, and deploy the system on an ready-to-go tablet. 
(iii) \textbf{Protocol Compliance}: \comm{Both safety and protocol need to be enforced. Both traiing and monitoring to be used.}
We will adopt real-time in-conversation guardrails to
monitor critical situations like negative emotion, suicide intention, etc.

\textbf{Aim 2: Conduct a feasibility study among 40
socially isolated older adults (age $\geq$ 75) with MCI or normal
cognition to evaluate the AI and identify areas for refinement.}
We will recruit participants to use our chatbot and complete brief
surveys. Each participant will receive 24 sessions in 6 weeks (4
sessions per week). Each session will be an independent 15-minute
conversation with the chatbot. A staff member will complete weekly
15-minute check-in phone calls to assess emotional status and potential
risks in using AI. We will collect both objective data and subjective
surveys to assess feasibility, acceptability, and safety. (i)
\textbf{Adherence}. We will collect the adherence rate, the proportion of
participants who complete $\geq$80\% of sessions, and an engagement
measure (participant word ratio). (ii) \textbf{Acceptability}. Each
participant will complete a survey after 6 weeks that assesses
satisfaction, willingness to use the device in the future, perceived
empathy, and preferences in interaction modality. \comm{to align with approach and data analysis.}

\textbf{Impact}. Our team is highly interdisciplinary, comprising
computer scientists, a neurologist, and a statistician in study design and
analytics, all with extensive experience in Alzheimer's disease
research. This proposed project is especially timely,
addressing the growing demand for complementary alternatives to
traditional human-led interventions. If feasible and acceptable,
AI-CONECT will enable scalable conversational engagement for socially
isolated older adults and inform future, large-scale studies.

\section{Significance}

% \textbf{ADRD is prevalent but remains difficult to treat.}
Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) is a world-wide disease yet difficult to treat, because available pharmacologic options are limited by side effects, high cost, and restricted eligibility for newer disease-modifying therapies\cite{zhang2024recent}. 
As millions of patients remain without accessible treatment
options, it was estimated that up to $\sim 40\%$ of AD risk
may be attributable to modifiable factors. Thus, behavioral
interventions present a critical opportunity to alter trajectories and
reduce the growing burden of ADRD\cite{livingston2020dementia}. 
% Social isolation is a well-documented, potentially modifiable risk factor:
For example, epidemiological research has associated social isolation with greater risk of cognitive decline and dementia \cite{evans2019social,kallianpur2023weak,nasem2020social,penninkilampi2018association,poey2017social,shen2022associations}, and showed that reducing social isolation could approximately prevent 4\% of dementia cases\cite{livingston2020dementia}, motivating the development of social isolation targeted interventions \comm{cite intervetions}.

\textbf{Effective conversational intervention was found in clinical trial, but its scalable delivery remains challenging.}
% Thus, it is essential to explore how to deliver intervention at
% population scale for older adults against social isolation and thereby dementia.
Recently, the Internet-based conversational intervention, I-CONECT (NIH-funded clinical trial NCT02871921) which uses frequent semi-structured conversational interactions, was proven to be effective in mitigating cognitive decline among socially isolated older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI)\cite{dodge2024internet}.
% Recently, the I-CONECT clinical trial
% (NCT02871921) provides rigorous experimental evidence that frequent,
% semi-structured conversational interactions delivered via video chat can
% mitigate cognitive declines among socially isolated older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI)
% \cite{dodge2024internet}. 
However, its key limitation, as a foundation for public health impact, is
feasibility for wide dissemination: the intervention relies on well-trained interviewer to deliver, which is workforce intensive and costly. 
Scaling the intervention requires recruiting, training, and supervising staff, plus complex scheduling and quality assurance, which can increase costs and reduce delivery consistency and quality. 
% As a result, despite efficacy, the method is difficult to sustain for socially
% isolated older adults who need high-frequency engagement.

\textbf{AI-based intervention is a scalable alternative but under explored.}
Confronting the challenge, the emergence of Generative AI tehnologies, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs) that can chat fluently at low cost and replicatable with consistent quality\comm{cite genai papers}, has fostered new opportunities for scalable conversational intervention.
% Recent conversational AI systems can generate highly fluent
% conversations at low marginal cost, suggesting a plausible path to scale conversational intervention.
The estimated cost reduction is significant: based on OpenAI GPT-4o pricing (July 2024
\cite{openai2024pricing}), a twice-per-week, one-year service would cost
0.3\% of an estimated human-delivered service cost, based on 2024 salary estimates\cite{ziprecruiter2024chat,hong2024aconect}.
% For example, based on OpenAI GPT-4o pricing (July 2024
% \cite{openai2024pricing}), a twice-per-week, one-year service would cost
% on the order of \$7.68 in model usage fees (0.3\% of an estimated
% \$2,496/year human-delivered service cost, based on 2024 salary estimates
% \cite{ziprecruiter2024chat}). 
Despite the promise, the AI-based interactions remains large systematic gap to the human-delivered conversational intervention limiting the engagement and thereby the efficacy.

Barriers:
(1) Scientific-foundation: Most chatbots around these days do not have any scientific background nor evidence-based efficacy proven approach to address cognitive functions.
(2) Engagement
(3) Technology barrier
(4) Safety concern

Solution:
(1) Science-driven design: RCT-based design, integrating efficacy-proven components from I-CONECT: reminiscence, vocabulary enhancement, and critical thinking. This is implemented via protocol alignment.
(2) 




Yet the rigor of evidence for AI-based conversational intervention remains limited:
it is not established that an AI system can reliably implement the
I-CONECT interview protocol, sustain engagement in older
adults with MCI or NC, or operate safely in real-world
settings. 
Our preliminary work suggests that Large Language Models (LLMs) can be
steered via customized prompts to increase engagement in simulated
conversations with simulated participants \cite{hong2024aconect}. Though it showed a promising way to develop the chatbot, it was under-optimized for older
adults (e.g., limited modality/device adaptation, engagement and therapy implementation), and its safety and feasibility in the target population is unknown. Specifically, deployment with vulnerable older adults poses higher safety risks (e.g., misinformation,
biased or harmful content, privacy breaches, emotional distress) and therefore the feasibility could be concerned. 
Thus, rigorous development and evaluation are needed to determine whether
AI-based conversational intervention can be a scalable, safe, and
effective alternative to human-delivered programs.

\comm{Add multi-modality and interactivity}

\textbf{AI-CONECT aims to translate I-CONECT to scalable, safety-aware delivery and evaluate its feasibility.}
This R21 directly addresses the scalability barrier by translating the
evidence-based I-CONECT conversational protocol into an AI-delivered
system (AI-CONECT) designed for older adults. 
If successful, this project will shift the field from
workforce-limited, interviewer-dependent conversational interventions to
protocol-faithful, on-demand delivery that can be disseminated at scale.
\emph{Scientifically}, the project will improve knowledge of conversational intervention by evaluating if
AI-based conversational system is feasible and satisfiable to execute
I-CONECT intervention protocols in socially isolated older adults with MCI or normal cognition. 
\emph{Technically}, it will advance the state of AI-based conversational
interventions by directly addressing key implementation challenges:
maintaining protocol fidelity to the I-CONECT workflow, enhancing
engagement during extended sessions through cognitively demanding
prompts and turn-taking support, reducing technology barriers via a
voice-forward multimodal interface, and incorporating safety-aware
monitoring to mitigate risks (e.g., misinformation, financial
exploitation, or emotional distress) during home use.
\emph{Clinically}, it will pave ways for the use of AI in future behavioral interventions.

% If successful, this project will shift the field from
% workforce-limited, interviewer-dependent conversational interventions to
% protocol-faithful, on-demand delivery that can be disseminated at scale. It would enable larger and more
% diverse prevention studies, reduce per-participant delivery costs, and
% support future implementation of conversational engagement as a broadly
% accessible service for older adults at risk for cognitive decline.

\section{INNOVATION}

\textbf{Clinical Innovation: Translating human-delivered intervention to AI-based conversational system.}
AI-CONECT is innovative in directly translating a proven, interviewer-led dementia prevention intervention into a protocol-faithful, AI-delivered system tailored for socially isolated older adults. This systematic translation enables high-fidelity automation of the intervention, thereby opening a new paradigm for scaling evidence-based conversational intervention.

\textbf{Technology Innovation 1: Cost-effective automatic optimization of AI chatbot via clinical-trial-grounded participant simulation.}
% \textbf{Technology Innovation 1: Accelerating cohort-oriented development of AI chatbots via data-driven simulation.} 
Developing an AI chatbot for the specific population (e.g., socially isolated older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI)) is limited by scarce data, high evaluation cost, and the risk of deploying immature designs. We introduce a data-driven simulation framework to model cohort-typical language and engagement behaviors and to stress-test candidate chatbot behaviors \emph{before} involving older adults. Unlike previous simulation methods~\cite{wang2024patient}, our method is grounded in recorded I-CONECT conversations (enabling us to capture unique MCI traits) and intervention goals (e.g., engagement and reminiscence). This approach refines and extends existing chatbot development methods by adding quantitative, intervention-relevant virtual evaluation environment that enable rapid iteration, transparent comparison across versions, and earlier identification of failure modes (e.g., low engagement, protocol drift or safety risks), thereby reducing development time and risk.

\comm{What barrier are you addressing here? Engaging? Make sure you specify it in Aim page.}
\textbf{Technology Innovation 2: Enhancing participant engagement via user-friendly multi-modality interaction designs.}
For socially isolated older adults with MCI, technology burden is a primary barrier to sustained engagement, particularly for systems that assume typing, app navigation, or complex setup.
When they faces a digital device, their attention can be easily distracted.
Using proper prompts/cues can effectively draw their attention and stimulate cognitive functions \cite{carey2019behavior}.
We will apply and extend multimodal human--computer interaction approaches by delivering a \emph{voice-forward} system (real-time speech input/output) with simple visual, emotion-responsive feedback designed for older-adult accessibility. 
To reduce interaction complexity while supporting engagement, we will deploy the chatbot on a ready-to-use tablet paired with an emotion-aware social robot that provides immediate affective cues. Compared with conventional chat interfaces, this design lowers operational demands and enables more natural conversational flow aligned with the I-CONECT interaction style.
To draw participants' attention and stimulate users' cognitive functions, we will leverage AI to generate personalized images based on the learned personal preferences in multiple sessions, as complementary prompts/cues to I-CONECT image and lanugage prompts.

% For socially isolated older adults with MCI, technology burden is a primary barrier to sustained engagement, particularly for systems that assume typing, app navigation, or complex setup. We will apply and extend multimodal human--computer interaction approaches by delivering a \emph{voice-forward} system (real-time speech input/output) with simple visual, emotion-responsive feedback designed for older-adult accessibility.

Compared with conventional chat interfaces, this design lowers operational demands and enables more natural conversational flow aligned with the I-CONECT interaction style.


\section{Approach}

\textbf{Overall Strategy.} We will develop an AI-based conversational system (AI-CONECT) to implement the I-CONECT intervention strategies and evaluate its feasibility and satisfaction among socially isolated older adults with MCI or normal cognition.

\textbf{C.1 Intervention Strategy}

The intervention protocol is modified from I-CONECT~\cite{dodge2024internet} to fit the AI-based intervention.
Each session will last for 15 minutes following the conversation flow: starting from greeting, image/topic presentation, open conversation where reminiscence and vocabulary enhancement will be executed spontaneously.
(1) \textit{Image and Language Prompts}. We adopt the same image and language prompts as I-CONECT to stimulate participants' interests and cognitive functions. The prompts includes topics were selected in I-CONECT study, that initiate the conversations with little motivations.
(2) \textit{Reminiscence with Visual interactions}. We will engage participants in reminiscence by asking
about their personal experiences related to the presented images and topics. With the AI tools, the participants will engage in generating personalized images based on the conversation and AI memory from prior sessions.
(3) \textit{Vocabulary Enhancement with Hints}. We will prompt the participants to describe the presented images in detail to enhance their vocabulary usage. AI will guide the participants to describe specific details by providing visual hints, e.g., zooming in on image parts.
% strategy addresses two main principles: (1)
% \emph{\ul{Cognitively-Demanding Conversation Strategies}}: This includes
% engaging users in novel chat experiences to stimulate their cognitive
% functions, which may enhance brain connectivity and resist
% neurodegeneration. Strategies of engaging includes providing visual
% information, novel chat themes and cognitively-demanding topics to
% stimulate users' cognitive activities. (2) \emph{\ul{User-Friendly
% Device}}: Frequent engagement essentials the accessibility of the
% service. Thus, we will design a user-friendly device that lowers the
% barrier for technologically challenged older adults to use the service
% at any time. Data privacy is also emphasized to build trust with users
% and comply with regulations like HIPAA. Overall, these strategies aim to
% provide cognitive benefits through interactive and engaging
% conversations tailored to the needs and capabilities of socially
% isolated older adults.

\textbf{C.2 Chatbot Development}

We develop AI-based chatbot to implement the intervention strategies with three components: (1) implementing intervention strategies via customizing AI, (2) virtual validation to drive AI optimization, (3) safety assurance, and (4) device development.
All development or deployments will be carried out in HIPAA-compliant servers to ensure data privacy.

\comm{Fig: Need to discuss the check-in call (how to?) and feasibility study in text using the same ID.}

\textbf{(1) Optimizing AI for Protocol Compliance via Learning from Verifiable Feedback.}
We will customize Large Language Models (LLMs) to implement the I-CONECT intervention strategies. We will first engineer prompts that instruct LLMs to carry out predefined tasks, including proposing chat themes and topics, and presenting topic-related images. To enhance LLM's capability in engaging users in 15-min conversations, we will improve the conversation engagement using heuristics and data from the I-CONECT trials. On the one hand, we will consult interviewers and related researchers (from I-CONECT team) to provide heuristic conversation strategies and encode the heuristics in the instructions for LLMs. On the other hand, we will \textit{supervised-finetune} the LLMs to learn the spontaneous language patterns, for example, the active use of filler words, from interviewers' speech in the I-CONECT conversation data. The conversation data will be processed from audio recordings, and we will develop speaker-aware Automatic Speech Recognition to extract high-quality text data for LLMs finetuning.
Then, we will train LLMs to learn from the \textit{feedback} on the compliance in conversations. Every time the LLM had a conversation with a user (participant), we will use rule-based method to rate the protocol compliance (engagement time, reminiscence-induction frequency, and user vocabulary). The ratings will be used to train a reward model that guides the LLMs to generate protocol-compliant conversations via Reinforcement Learning with (Human) Feedback (RLVF)\cite{ouyang2022training}.
\comm{Cite my ICRA paper.}

\textbf{(2) Learning to Simulate Human Feedback from I-CONECT Data.}
The RLHF relies on conversation between the chatbot and real users to collect feedback. However, collecting feedback from real users is costly and risky, especially when the users are socially isolated older adults with MCI. To reduce the cost and risk, we will create virtual users that are LLMs finetuned on old adults' recorded conversations and then simulate conversations with the socially-isolated older adults to quantitatively evaluate the chatbot. The simulation will learn the I-CONECT participants' language traits that may drive the engagement designs. To provide a concrete simulation of older adults with MCI, we will validate that the virtual users can generate similar language symptoms that have been proven effective for MCI diagnosis \cite{hoang2023subject}. 


\textbf{Multi-modality Interaction: Voice}

\textbf{Multi-modality Interaction: Image}

\textbf{Multi-modality Interaction: 3D Scene Recreation and Exploration}
Co-crafting life stories in photocollage can enhance the engagement among older adults\cite{keisari2021crafting}


\textbf{(3) Safety Assurance via Real-time Monitoring.}
For safety purposes, we will examine the biased content generated by LLMs in the conversations. We will fix the problems by creating a cleaned dataset and continually fine-tuning LLMs to forget the contents \cite{liu2024rethinking}.
Yet, unknown risks may arise at deployment.
To eliminate such risks, we will create real-time safety guardrails that monitor the conversations and detect critical situations like low emotion, suicide, misinformation, or financial risks.
The guardrails will use generative rule-based methods, where an GuardAgent will generate guardrail rules to screen out unsafe generation in conversations\cite{xiang2024guardagent}.

\textbf{(4) Device and Interface Development}: We will develop an old-adult-centered
interface and device to facilitate the accessibility of our chatbot service.
We will minimize the operation complexities for older adults such that
older adults without computer-use experience can easily start a
conversation in natural language. The service will be available 24 hours
a day through voice, which is friendly for older adults with difficulty
typing. We will get feedback from survey participants on the
accessibility and improve the designs accordingly. Finally, we will
deliver an AI-empowered voice chatbot software that can be installed in
portable hardware, which implements I-CONECT conversation strategies and
attains high satisfaction from our survey participants.



% \textbf{(1) Implementing Intervention Strategies via Customizing AI}: We
% use the advanced Large Language Model (LLM) as the core of AI, which is
% able to communicate with humans in natural language. We will customize
% the state-of-the-art LLM (GPT-4o or its variants) to follow the
% intervention strategies from the I-CONECT project. We will engineer
% prompts that instruct LLMs to carry out predefined tasks, including
% proposing chat themes and topics, and presenting topic-related images.
% To enhance LLM's capability in engaging users in 15-min conversations,
% we will improve the conversation engagement using heuristics and data
% from the I-CONECT trials. On the one hand, we will consult interviewers
% and related researchers (from I-CONECT team) to provide heuristic
% conversation strategies and encode the heuristics in the instructions
% for LLMs. On the other hand, we will finetune the LLMs to learn the
% spontaneous language patterns, for example, the active use of filler
% words, from interviewers' speech in the I-CONECT conversation data. The
% conversation data will be processed from audio recordings, and we will
% develop speaker-aware Automatic Speech Recognition to extract
% high-quality text data for LLMs finetuning. 
% % To avoid LLMs memorizing or
% % being biased toward users' private information, for example, personal
% % experiences that should not be shared with a third party, we will use
% % privacy-preserving machine learning in the process\cite{xiang2024guardagent}.

% \textbf{(2) Virtual Validation to Drive AI Optimization}: To validate the implementation of the conversation strategies, we will
% validate the implementation of the conversation strategies, we will
% create virtual users that are LLMs finetuned on old adults' recorded
% conversations and then simulate conversations with the socially-isolated
% older adults to quantitatively evaluate the chatbot. The simulation will
% learn the I-CONECT participants' language traits that may drive the
% engagement designs. To provide a concrete simulation of older adults
% with MCI, we will validate that the virtual users can generate similar
% language symptoms that have been proven effective for MCI diagnosis
% \cite{hoang2023subject}. For safety purposes, we will examine the biased content
% generated by LLMs in the conversations. We will fix the problems by
% creating a cleaned dataset and continually fine-tuning LLMs to forget
% the contents \cite{liu2024rethinking}.

% \textbf{Virtual Evaluation during Development}. We will evaluate the chatbot in both virtual and human
% evaluations to validate if the chatbot is able to implement the same
% intervention strategies as the human interviewers. (1) \emph{\ul{Virtual
% Testing}}. In the early stage of development, we adopt a cost-effective
% method to evaluate the chatbot, where we simulate conversations between
% the designed chatbot and a virtual user. The virtual user is constructed
% as a digital simulation of a real old adult with or without mild
% cognitive impairment. Extensive simulation enables scalable tests to
% study how well the chatbot follows the intervention strategies. In the
% simulation, we will use GPT-4o to automatically examine if the chatbot
% will stick to the principles of intervention strategies to provide novel
% chat experiences and visual stimulations (through external visual
% tools).

% \textbf{Safety Guardrails.}

% \textbf{(3) Device Development}: We will develop an old-adult-centered
% interface device to facilitate the accessibility of our chatbot service.
% We will minimize the operation complexities for older adults such that
% older adults without computer-use experience can easily start a
% conversation in natural language. The service will be available 24 hours

% accessibility and improve the designs accordingly. Finally, we will
% deliver an AI-empowered voice chatbot software that can be installed in
% portable hardware, which implements I-CONECT conversation strategies and
% attains high satisfaction from our survey participants.



\textbf{C.3 Approach for Feasibility Study.} 

We will test the chatbot at the Memory Division of the Massachusetts Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (MADRC) and I-CONECT Foundation. 
40 older adults will be recruited to complete
feasibility/satisfaction surveys on their overall experience in terms of
adherence, happiness, emotional lifting, empathy, and trustworthiness
(e.g., reporting harmful or hateful biases). The survey will also
provide insights into how to design the chatbot to engage humans and
increase social interactions.

Each participant will receive 15-min conversation with our chatbot for
24 sessions in 6 weeks (4 sessions per week). A staff member will do
weekly 15-min check-in phone calls to assess the emotional status and
potential risks in using AI.
In 6 weeks, we will collect both objective data and
subjective surveys to assess the feasibility and satisfaction.

To isolate the effects of social engagement from confounding factors, the study incorporates three key design elements. First, we employ chatbot persona rotation across participants to enhance interaction variability and minimize emotional bonding confounds, with personas drawn from a pool based on I-CONECT interviewer profiles. Second, our intuitive interface and natural-sounding voice capabilities enable participants lacking internet or webcam proficiency to participate in conversations without additional cognitive burden from technology learning. Third, we leverage the standardized daily themes and image stimuli from I-CONECT to support participants in organizing and expressing their ideas within conversations\cite{dodge2024internet}.

\comm{Add details about survey. }

\section{DATA PROCESSING AND ANALYSES}

\textbf{Aim 1}: We will use I-CONECT recorded conversations to evaluate
and optimize the chatbot design for better implementation of the
I-CONECT protocol.

\textbf{Method: Processing I-CONECT Data and Constructing Digital
Twins.} We will use the existing I-CONECT audiovisual corpus of older
adult interviews (with and without mild cognitive impairment, MCI) to
design and optimize the AI-CONECT chatbot. All data will be processed on
HIPAA-compliant servers with identifiers removed.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \textbf{Data preprocessing:} Audio will be transcribed using a
  speaker-aware ASR optimized for older adult speech, separating
  interviewer and participant utterances. Transcripts will be aligned
  with metadata, and quality checked manually and automatically.
\item
  \textbf{Annotation and feature extraction:} We will extract
  conversational and linguistic features (e.g., word counts, lexical
  diversity, reminiscence markers) from transcripts. A subset will be
  manually annotated for reminiscence and cognitively demanding prompts.
\item
  \textbf{Digital twin construction:} We will create LLM-based "digital
  twins" of older adult participants by fine-tuning models on aggregated
  participant data (not verbatim transcripts) to simulate their language
  patterns and engagement behaviors, reflecting differences between MCI
  and cognitively normal participants.
\item
  \textbf{Simulation-based evaluation:} The digital twins will simulate
  large-scale conversations with the AI-CONECT chatbot, enabling
  low-cost testing and controlled experimentation by varying chatbot
  strategies.
\item
  \textbf{Virtual benchmarks:} We will establish quantitative
  performance benchmarks against I-CONECT targets, including:

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    \textbf{Engagement:} Participant word ratio (participant words/total
    words).
  \item
    \textbf{Reminiscence:} Reminiscence turn ratio (autobiographical
    turns/total participant turns).
  \item
    \textbf{Vocabulary enhancement:} Lexical richness indices (e.g.,
    type--token ratio).
  \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Iterative optimization:} Simulation results will guide
successive optimization cycles, revising chatbot parameters that fail to
meet engagement or reminiscence thresholds. Only validated chatbot
configurations will advance to human testing.

Collectively, Aim 1 establishes a rigorous, data-driven foundation for
translating the I-CONECT intervention protocol into a scalable, AI-based
conversational system while minimizing risk prior to human deployment.

\textbf{Aim 2}: We will conduct a survey to evaluate the feasibility of using AI as an alternative to a human-led one.

We will recruit a total of \textbf{40 socially isolated older adults
aged $\geq75$ years}, including \textbf{20 individuals with mild cognitive
impairment (MCI)} and \textbf{20 cognitively normal (NC)} participants.
This sample size is designed to support the \textbf{primary aims of
feasibility and user satisfaction}, rather than to test intervention
efficacy.

\textbf{Feasibility (Adherence).} The primary feasibility outcome is
adherence to the intervention, defined at the participant level as
completion of \textbf{$\geq80\%$ of scheduled AI-CONECT sessions}. A total
sample size of \textbf{N=40} allows estimation of the overall adherence
proportion with adequate precision for feasibility assessment. For
example, assuming an expected adherence rate of approximately
\textbf{80\%}, N=40 yields a 95\% confidence interval with a half-width
of approximately \textbf{$\pm 12\%$}, which is sufficient to determine
whether adherence meets the predefined feasibility threshold. This level
of precision is appropriate for an R21 feasibility study and supports
clear \textbf{go/no-go decisions} for future scale-up.\\
Including \textbf{20 MCI and 20 NC participants} ensures that
feasibility can be assessed across two cognitively distinct but relevant
subpopulations. With \textbf{N=20 per group}, adherence rates can be
estimated separately for MCI and NC participants with acceptable
precision for feasibility purposes, allowing identification of
group-specific implementation challenges (e.g., differential session
completion, technology burden, or need for support) without powering the
study for between-group efficacy comparisons.

\textbf{Satisfactory Outcome: Acceptability} of the AI-CONECT
intervention will be evaluated using the Client Satisfaction
Questionnaire--8 (CSQ-8), a validated measure of user satisfaction for
health and behavioral interventions, with total scores ranging from 8 to
32 and higher scores indicating greater satisfaction.
\textbf{Acceptability will be defined a priori using explicit,
quantitative criteria}, such that the intervention will be considered
well accepted if the \textbf{mean CSQ-8 score is $\geq24$}, \textbf{at least
70\% of participants achieve CSQ-8 scores $\geq24$}, and \textbf{no more than
15\% of participants score $\leq20$}, indicating the absence of systematic
dissatisfaction. A total sample size of \textbf{N=40 (20 MCI and 20
cognitively normal participants)} is sufficient for this purpose because
it provides adequate precision to evaluate these criteria without
hypothesis testing. Specifically, if approximately 70\% of participants
meet the satisfaction threshold (CSQ-8 $\geq24$), a sample of 40 yields a
95\% confidence interval with a half-width of approximately
\textbf{$\pm 14\%$}, allowing us to distinguish between unacceptably low
satisfaction (e.g., $<55$--$60\%$) and satisfaction levels
consistent with good acceptability. Similarly, with N=40, the mean CSQ-8
score can be estimated with sufficient precision to determine whether it
exceeds the prespecified benchmark of 24, while also allowing assessment
of score variability and detection of potential ceiling or floor
effects. The allocation of \textbf{20 participants per cognitive
subgroup} further allows acceptability to be summarized separately for
MCI and cognitively normal older adults, enabling identification of
subgroup-specific usability or burden concerns.
This precision-based justification aligns with the feasibility and
acceptability aims of the study and supports clear go/no-go decisions
for refinement and future trials, consistent with the exploratory intent
of the R21 mechanism.

\textbf{Exploratory Outcomes.} Additional measures, including cognitive
assessments, will be collected for exploratory and descriptive purposes
only. Instead, these measures will be used to evaluate feasibility of
remote assessment, completion rates, and data quality, and to generate
preliminary signals to inform the design of future trials.

In summary, a total sample size of \textbf{20 MCI and 20 NC
participants} is well-suited to the goals of this R21 by providing
sufficient precision to evaluate adherence-based feasibility and user
satisfaction, while remaining consistent with the exploratory and
developmental intent of the mechanism and the ``clinical trial not
allowed'' designation.

\section{POTENTIAL Risks AND ALTERNATIVE STRATEGIES}

The project
faces additional risks that are not fully resolved by the above approach,
with corresponding alternative strategies:
\textbf{(1) Poor infrastructure or environment conditions.} In real-world
home conditions (e.g., intermittent connectivity, background noise, device
microphone/speaker failures, or latency that disrupts turn-taking), usability and session completion could be reduced. As
alternatives, we will implement a more efficient conversation flow that can
operate with lower bandwidth (longer pause between turns allowing more time for caching data), provide
rapid device health checks and remote troubleshooting, and maintain spare
devices for swap-out.
\textbf{(2) Device malfunctioning}. Device could be lost, damaged, or malfunctioning during the study, which could lead to missing data and reduced adherence. As alternatives, we will maintain spare devices for swap-out, provide rapid remote troubleshooting, and implement regular device health checks to identify issues early.
\textbf{(3) LLM/API server downtime or rate limiting}. Dependence on third-party API services could lead to interruptions in chatbot availability due to server downtime or rate limiting, which could affect session completion and user experience. As alternatives, we will monitor API status continuously, implement caching strategies to handle temporary outages, and maintain a contingency plan to switch to alternative services or local models if necessary.
\textbf{(4) Model and platform drift} during the project
(e.g., changes in third-party model behavior, pricing, rate limits, or
content policies) could cause regressions in protocol compliance,
engagement, or latency. As alternatives, we will pin model versions when
possible, maintain an automated regression test suite based on the virtual
benchmarks, and keep a contingency path to switch to an alternative model
or a smaller on-premise model for core dialogue behaviors if external
dependencies become unstable.
\textbf{(5) Reluctance to use an always-listening voice system} due to
privacy perceptions (e.g., concerns about recording, surveillance, or data
sharing) could limit participation even if the system is technically
HIPAA compliant. As alternatives, we will strengthen transparency and
participant control by (i) clearly communicating what is captured and for
how long, (ii) minimizing data retention by default (store transcripts and
derived features when feasible rather than raw audio), and (iii) providing a
participant-facing privacy control (e.g., an explicit ``pause''/``mute''
feature and opt-out choices for storage).

\section{IMPACT}

Our team is highly interdisciplinary, comprising a
statistician, a neurologist, and multiple computer scientists in trial
design/analytics, all with extensive experience in AD research. This R21
is especially timely, addressing the growing demand for complementary
alternatives to traditional human-led interventions. If feasible and
successful, it will greatly increase the accessibility of early dementia
intervention for socially isolated older adults.
