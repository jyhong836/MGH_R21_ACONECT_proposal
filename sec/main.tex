\textbf{Specific Aims}

\textbf{Significance}. Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD)
remain a major and growing public health burden, and the disease's
multifactorial biology continues to outpace the impact of available
therapies\cite{zhang2024recent}. Current U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved
symptomatic treatments offer modest benefits, while newer disease-modifying anti-amyloid immunotherapies are
limited to biomarker-confirmed early Alzheimer's disease and are
accompanied by restricted patient eligibility and significant treatment
burden with cost-effectiveness concerns\cite{mangalagiu2025pharmacological}. 
Thus, it is important to develop accessible and affordable prevention strategies early in the disease course.

\textbf{Critical Barriers.} Social isolation is a recognized, modifiable
risk factor for cognitive decline in older adults
\cite{evans2019social,kallianpur2023weak,nasem2020social,penninkilampi2018association,poey2017social,shen2022associations}. However, effective interventions that can deliver frequent social engagement at the population scale remain limited.
The recent clinical trial (I-CONECT; NCT02871921) showed that
semi-structured conversational engagement with cognitive stimulation can mitigate social isolation and cognitive decline among socially isolated older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI)\cite{dodge2024internet}. Yet, \textit{human-delivered interventions are constrained by workforce availability and high cost}, rendering a persistent barrier to broad dissemination.
In response to this challenge, conversational AI has the potential to provide scalable conversational engagement; however, most existing AI systems\cite{ouyang2022training} have not encoded essential scientific methods for dementia prevention.
In our preliminary study\cite{hong2024aconect}, we showed that Large Language Models (LLMs) can be customized to approximately follow the I-CONECT protocol in simulated textual conversations. 
However, compared with human-led conversations, the system remained under-optimized for engaging older adults, including limited interactivity; technical barriers for older adults to operate computers; unverified compliance with I-CONECT protocols and safety rules; and unvalidated feasibility.

\textbf{Solutions.} To enhance the accessibility and affordability of
the I-CONECT intervention, we propose to develop a Conversational AI with Multimodal Interaction (AIMI-CONECT) by leveraging advanced
generative AI to simulate human-delivered conversational engagement (I-CONECT). 
To address the limitations in our preliminary study\cite{hong2024aconect}, our specific aims are:

\textbf{Aim 1: Develop a conversational AI with multimodal interaction (AIMI-CONECT) to execute the I-CONECT intervention.} 
We will use an agentic AI system driven by an LLM to follow the I-CONECT protocol.
(i) \textbf{Multimodal interaction} augments user engagement by enabling human-AI collaborative recreation and exploration of 3D reminiscence scenes, voice chat, and visual affective responses\cite{zhao2025transferring}.
(ii) \textbf{Usability}: To reduce barriers for older adults, we will integrate a ready-to-go social robot with a real-time, responsive audio interface that does not require typing or frequent button presses.
(iii) \textbf{Protocol Compliance}:
We will utilize machine learning algorithms to align LLM behavior with the protocol and adopt real-time, in-conversation guardrails to monitor critical situations, including protocol drift, negative affect, and other safety risks.

\textbf{Aim 2: Conduct a feasibility study among 40
socially isolated older adults (age $\geq$ 75) with MCI or normal
cognition to evaluate the AI and identify areas for refinement.}
We will recruit participants to use our chatbot and complete brief
surveys. Each participant will receive 24 sessions in 6 weeks (4
sessions per week). Each session will be an independent 15-minute
conversation with the chatbot. A staff member will complete weekly
15-minute check-in phone calls to assess emotional status and potential
risks in using AI. We will collect both objective data and subjective
surveys to assess feasibility, acceptability, and safety. (i)
\textbf{Adherence}. We will collect the adherence rate, the proportion of
participants who complete $\geq$80\% of sessions, and an engagement
measure (participant word ratio). (ii) \textbf{Acceptability}. Each
participant will complete a survey after 6 weeks that assesses
satisfaction, willingness to use the device in the future, perceived
empathy, and preferences for interaction modality. \comm{to align with approach and data analysis.}

\textbf{Impact}. Our team is highly interdisciplinary, comprising
computer scientists, a neurologist, and a statistician in study design and
analytics, all with extensive experience in Alzheimer's disease
research. This proposed project is especially timely,
addressing the growing demand for complementary alternatives to
traditional human-led interventions. If feasible and acceptable,
AIMI-CONECT will enable scalable conversational engagement for socially
isolated older adults and inform future, large-scale studies.

\section{Significance}

Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) is a world-wide disease yet difficult to treat, because available pharmacologic options are limited by side effects, high cost, and restricted eligibility for newer disease-modifying therapies\cite{zhang2024recent}. 
As millions of patients remain without accessible treatment
options, it was estimated that up to $\sim 40\%$ of AD risk
may be attributable to modifiable factors. 
For example, epidemiological research has associated social isolation with greater risk of cognitive decline and dementia \cite{evans2019social,kallianpur2023weak,nasem2020social,penninkilampi2018association,poey2017social,shen2022associations}. Meanwhile, it was estimated that reducing social isolation could approximately prevent 4\% of dementia cases\cite{livingston2020dementia}, motivating the development of social isolation targeted behavioral interventions\cite{dodge2015web,yu2021iconect,otake2021picmor,watanabemiura2025picmoa}.

\textbf{Conversational intervention was proven effetive, but its scalable delivery remains challenging.}
Recently, the Internet-based conversational intervention, I-CONECT (NIH-funded clinical trial NCT02871921) which uses frequent semi-structured conversational interactions, was proven to be effective in mitigating cognitive decline among socially isolated older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI)\cite{dodge2024internet}.
However, its key limitation, as a foundation for public health impact, is
feasibility for wide dissemination: the intervention relies on well-trained interviewer to deliver, which is workforce intensive and costly. 
Scaling the intervention requires recruiting, training, and supervising staff, plus complex scheduling and quality assurance, which can increase costs and reduce delivery consistency and quality. 

\textbf{Conversational AI provides a scalable alternative but is under explored.}
In response to this challenge, the emergence of conversational AI driven by Large Language Models (LLMs) that can chat fluently at low cost and be replicated with consistent quality\cite{ouyang2022training} has fostered new opportunities for scalable conversational intervention.
The estimated cost reduction is significant: based on OpenAI GPT-4o pricing (July 2024
\cite{openai2024pricing}), a twice-per-week, one-year service would cost
0.3\% of an estimated human-delivered service cost, based on 2024 salary estimates\cite{ziprecruiter2024chat,hong2024aconect}.
Despite the promise, most currently available conversational AI systems lack a scientific basis and an evidence-based, efficacy-proven approach to address cognitive function.
As an early attempt to apply conversational AI to an intervention, our prior work customized LLMs to follow the I-CONECT protocol via prompt engineering\cite{hong2024aconect}; however, it has multiple limitations:
(i) The single-modality conversation has limited interactivity and thereby lowers engagement compared to human-led ones; 
(ii) Older adults face technical barriers to operating computers and accessing the AI service, which may lead to low adherence; 
(iii) The intervention protocol was not adapted to AI, ignoring the unique challenges of AI-based intervention, for example, the potential safety risks and the protocol drift (failure to maintain protocol fidelity) during conversations\cite{zou2023universal,arike2025goaldrift}.
When older adults are socially isolated and are less likely to have been trained to handle such hazards, concerns about the reliability and safety of AI-based intervention may be heightened.
(iv) The system has not yet been evaluated in the target population; therefore, the feasibility of AI-based intervention remains uncertain.

\textbf{AIMI-CONECT aims to translate I-CONECT to scalable delivery.}
This project directly addresses the scalability barrier by translating the
evidence-based I-CONECT conversational protocol into an AI-delivered
system with multimodal interaction (AIMI-CONECT) designed for older adults. 
If successful, this project will shift the field from
workforce-limited conversational interventions to protocol-faithful, accessible, and on-demand delivery that can be disseminated at scale.
\emph{Scientifically}, the project will improve knowledge of conversational intervention by evaluating if
AI-based conversational intervention is feasible in socially isolated older adults with MCI or normal cognition.
\emph{Technically}, it will advance the state of AI-based conversational
interventions by directly addressing key challenges:
maintaining protocol compliance and usability, and enhancing engagement during extended sessions through multimodal interaction.
\emph{Clinically}, it will pave the way for the use of AI in future behavioral interventions.

\section{INNOVATION}

\textbf{From human-delivered to AI-based conversational intervention.}
AIMI-CONECT translates an efficacy-proven, interviewer-led dementia prevention intervention into a protocol-faithful, scalable AI-delivered system tailored for socially isolated older adults. This systematic translation adapts the I-CONECT protocol for AI delivery, addresses emergent safety risks, and evaluates feasibility to enable high-fidelity automation of future intervention delivery.

\textbf{Multimodal interaction enabled conversational AI system improving usability and engagement.} 
To mitigate the gap between human and AI engagement, particularly the gap caused by the low usability for older adults, AIMI-CONECT integrates multimodal interaction into the conversational system: (1) a \emph{voice}-forward interface (real-time speech input/output); (2) visual affective robot; (3) user-AI co-recreation of reminiscence 3D scene via conversational instructions. 
Compared with conventional chat interfaces, the compound design lowers operational demands enhancing usability, and enables more engaging conversations aligned with the I-CONECT goals.
Unique to this work, the 3D scene recreation allows the participants to actively engage in the reminiscence process as well as detailed item describing with enhanced vocabulary, which are key therapeutic components of the I-CONECT protocol, and thereby may strengthen the cognitive stimulation effects.

\textbf{Enhancing protocol compliance of AI via learning from clinical trial grounded conversation simulation.}
We leverage reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF)\cite{ouyang2022training} to align the LLM-based chatbot to the I-CONECT protocol.
Yet, when targeting the specific population (e.g., socially isolated older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI)), traditional RLHF is limited by scarce data and high cost to collect human feedback.
Thus, in the project, we introduce a data-driven simulation framework that can generate conversations between LLMs and virtual users that are LLMs fine-tuned on recorded conversations from the I-CONECT clinical trial.
Unlike previous simulation methods~\cite{wang2024patient}, our method is grounded in clinical-trial data (enabling us to capture unique MCI traits).
This approach refines and extends existing AI development methods by adding a quantitative, intervention-relevant virtual evaluation environment, thereby enabling rapid iteration and earlier identification of risks.


\section{Approach}

\textbf{Overall Strategy.} We will develop an AI-based conversational system (AIMI-CONECT) to implement the AI-adapted I-CONECT intervention protocol and evaluate its feasibility and satisfaction among socially isolated older adults with MCI or normal cognition.

\textbf{C.1 Intervention Protocol with Safety Assurance}

The intervention protocol is adapted from I-CONECT~\cite{dodge2024internet} to fit the AI-based intervention.
Each session will last 15 minutes and follow the conversation flow, starting with a greeting and image/topic presentation, followed by open conversation in which reminiscence and vocabulary enhancement are executed spontaneously.
(1) \textit{Image and Language Prompting for Critical Thinking}. We adopt the same image and language prompts as I-CONECT to stimulate participants' interests and cognitive function. The participant will be prompted with in-depth questions centered on the topics from the I-CONECT study.
% \comm{How to prompt critical thinking?}
(2) \textit{Reminiscence with Visual interactions}. We will engage participants in reminiscence by asking
about their personal experiences related to the presented images and topics. With the AI tools, the participants will engage in generating personalized 3D scenes based on the conversation and AI memory from prior sessions.
(3) \textit{Vocabulary Enhancement with Hints}. We will prompt the participants to describe the presented images in detail to enhance their vocabulary usage. AI will guide the participants to describe specific details by providing visual hints, e.g., zooming in on image parts.
% strategy addresses two main principles: (1)
% \emph{\ul{Cognitively-Demanding Conversation Strategies}}: This includes
% engaging users in novel chat experiences to stimulate their cognitive
% functions, which may enhance brain connectivity and resist
% neurodegeneration. Strategies of engaging includes providing visual
% information, novel chat themes and cognitively-demanding topics to
% stimulate users' cognitive activities. (2) \emph{\ul{User-Friendly
% Device}}: Frequent engagement essentials the accessibility of the
% service. Thus, we will design a user-friendly device that lowers the
% barrier for technologically challenged older adults to use the service
% at any time. Data privacy is also emphasized to build trust with users
% and comply with regulations like HIPAA. Overall, these strategies aim to
% provide cognitive benefits through interactive and engaging
% conversations tailored to the needs and capabilities of socially
% isolated older adults.
(4) \textit{Safety Assurance}. In contrast to the human-delivered protocol, we add safety assurance to define prohibited behaviors that should be avoided in conversations, for example, generating misinformation, financial advice, or harmful content.

\textbf{C.2 System Design with Multimodal Interaction.} 

The system is composed of three main modules: (1) A trained Chat LLM that is responsible for handling the conversation in text; (2) A multimodal interface rounte input from users (MCI/NC older users) to the Chatb LLM. (3) Backend processing includes safety monitoring and 3D generations are executed asynchronically to avoid blocking real-time interaction.

\textbf{(1) Voice interface.}
To enhance the accessibility of the chatbot for older adults, we will implement a voice-forward interface that enables natural spoken interaction. Specifically, user speech will be captured through an on-device microphone and converted to text using streaming speech-to-text (STT), so the dialogue manager can apply the I-CONECT conversation strategies in real time. The chatbot's responses will be produced as text and then rendered as natural-sounding speech via text-to-speech (TTS), allowing participants to engage without typing or reading long on-screen messages.
We will primarily use the OpenAI Realtime API to support low-latency, bidirectional audio streaming and automatic turn-taking (i.e., detecting when the participant has finished speaking and when the system should respond). This capability is important for older adults because it reduces the need for explicit controls such as ``push-to-talk'' buttons and minimizes conversational interruptions due to delayed responses. We will also log time-stamped transcripts (from STT) and system audio outputs (from TTS) to support protocol compliance checks and safety monitoring while avoiding storage of unnecessary identifiers.

  \vspace{-1.2\baselineskip}
\end{wrapfigure}
\textbf{(2) 3D Memory Scene Collaborative Recreation.}
To enhance the reminiscence and engagement, we will implement a user-AI collaborative 3D scene recreation system. Our preliminary work showed that the 3D scene creation can improve the participants' interest in using reminiscence chatbot\cite{kononovych2025visual}.
During conversations, the chatbot will prompt participants to describe specific details of their memory associated with the presented images (e.g., ``Can you tell me what this picture remind you of?''). Based on the participant's descriptions, the system will generate a personalized 3D scene that visually represents their memories and experiences related to the image. This process allows participants to actively engage in the reminiscence process, while also providing visual cues that can stimulate further conversation and cognitive activity. The 3D scenes will be generated asynchronously to ensure that they do not disrupt the real-time flow of conversation.


\textbf{(3) Safety Assurance via Real-time Monitoring.}
To manage the safety risks arising at deployment, we will create real-time safety guardrails that leverages LLMs to monitor the conversations and detect critical situations like low emotion, suicide, misinformation, or financial risks.
The guardrails will use generative rule-based methods, where an GuardAgent will generate guardrail rules to screen out unsafe generation in conversations\cite{xiang2024guardagent}.
The monitoring system will send alert to study staff when critical issues are identified.
Study staff in the loop works as an additional layer of protection via weekly check-in phone calls.

\textbf{(4) Device and Emotionally Responsive Robot}: 
The whole software will be developed using Node.js and pre-installed on a ready-to-go tablet, which will be delivered to participants.
Alongside the tablet, we will develop a emotionally responsive robot, with real-time facial experessions to provide affective responses.
The facial expressions are managed by the Chat LLM through function calling -- LLM will generate and send command to the robot on demand.
The connection between the facial robot and the tablet are established via bluetooth, which can maintain connection robustly.
The robot will be developed based on our consultant Dr. Chen's prior work\cite{zhao2025transferring}.
% We will develop an old-adult-centered interface and device to facilitate the accessibility of our chatbot service.
% We will minimize the operation complexities for older adults such that
% older adults without computer-use experience can easily start a
% conversation in natural language. 


\textbf{(5) Data privacy and system security.}
To ensure participants' data privacy and system security, we will implement the following measures. The OpenAI API will be served through HIPAA-compliant servers insight MGH, and all data will be encrypted in transit and at rest. We will minimize the collection of personally identifiable information (PII) and use de-identified data for analysis. Access to the system will be protected by secure authentication, and regular security audits will be conducted to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities. Additionally, we will provide clear information to participants about data usage and obtain informed consent that explicitly addresses privacy and security measures.

\textbf{C.3 Optimization Algorithms for Improving AI Protocol Compliance.} 

% \comm{To maintain the best responsiveness, we only train the planning model that runs on the backend. This minimizes the changes in production likes real-time API.}
% \comm{We will use RLHF to optimize the chatbot to follow the protocol. The reward model will be trained on the feedback of protocol compliance, which is rated by rule-based method. However, direct rating is expensive. Instead, we build simulation system plus LLM as evaluator on the simulated conversation. The simulation fidelity is guaranteed by fine-tuing LLMs on real clinical trial data.}
We will use RLHF to optimize the chatbot to follow the protocol. The reward model will be constructed based on the I-CONECT protocol, which is rated by rule-based method. However, direct rating is expensive. Instead, we build virtual users to simulate conversations. 
% The simulation fidelity is guaranteed by fine-tuing LLMs on real clinical trial data.

\textbf{(1) Learning to Simulate Human Feedback from I-CONECT Data.}
The RLHF relies on conversation between the chatbot and real users to collect feedback. However, collecting feedback from real users is costly and risky, especially when the users are socially isolated older adults with MCI. To reduce the cost and risk, we will create virtual users that are LLMs finetuned on old adults' recorded conversations and then simulate conversations with the socially-isolated older adults to quantitatively evaluate the chatbot. The simulation will learn the I-CONECT participants' language traits that may drive the engagement designs. To provide a concrete simulation of older adults with MCI, we will validate that the virtual users can generate similar language symptoms that have been proven effective for MCI diagnosis \cite{hoang2023subject}. 

\textbf{(2) Optimizing AI for Protocol Compliance via Learning from Verifiable Feedback.}
We will customize Large Language Models (LLMs) to implement the I-CONECT intervention strategies. We will first engineer prompts that instruct LLMs to carry out predefined tasks, including proposing chat themes and topics, and presenting topic-related images. To enhance LLM's capability in engaging users in 15-min conversations, we will improve the conversation engagement using heuristics and data from the I-CONECT trials. On the one hand, we will consult interviewers and related researchers (from I-CONECT team) to provide heuristic conversation strategies and encode the heuristics in the instructions for LLMs. On the other hand, we will \textit{supervised-finetune} the LLMs to learn the spontaneous language patterns, for example, the active use of filler words, from interviewers' speech in the I-CONECT conversation data. The conversation data will be processed from audio recordings, and we will develop speaker-aware Automatic Speech Recognition to extract high-quality text data for LLMs finetuning.
Then, we will train LLMs to learn from the \textit{feedback} on the compliance in conversations. Every time the LLM had a conversation with a user (participant), we will use rule-based method to rate the protocol compliance (engagement time, reminiscence-induction frequency, and user vocabulary). The ratings will be used to train a reward model that guides the LLMs to generate protocol-compliant conversations via Reinforcement Learning with (Human) Feedback (RLVF)\cite{ouyang2022training,yang2025advf}.


\textbf{C.4 Approach for Feasibility Study.} 

We will test the chatbot at the Memory Division of the Massachusetts Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (MADRC) and I-CONECT Foundation. 
40 older adults will be recruited to complete
feasibility/satisfaction surveys on their overall experience in terms of
adherence, happiness, emotional lifting, empathy, and trustworthiness
(e.g., reporting harmful or hateful biases). The survey will also
provide insights into how to design the chatbot to engage humans and
increase social interactions.

Each participant will receive 15-min conversation with our chatbot for
24 sessions in 6 weeks (4 sessions per week). A staff member will do
weekly 15-min check-in phone calls to assess the emotional status and
potential risks in using AI.
In 6 weeks, we will collect both objective data and
subjective surveys to assess the feasibility and satisfaction.

To isolate the effects of social engagement from confounding factors, the study incorporates three key design elements. (1) First, we employ chatbot persona rotation across participants to enhance interaction variability and minimize emotional bonding confounds, with personas drawn from a pool based on I-CONECT interviewer profiles. (2) Second, our intuitive interface and natural-sounding voice capabilities enable participants lacking internet or webcam proficiency to participate in conversations without additional cognitive burden from technology learning. (3) Third, we leverage the standardized daily themes and image stimuli from I-CONECT to support participants in organizing and expressing their ideas within conversations\cite{dodge2024internet}.

\comm{Add details about survey. }
\comm{Example: Do you change your perception about using AI. Perecentage of attrition..}

\textbf{Participant Recruitment}. We will recruit a total of \textbf{40
socially isolated older adults aged $\geq75$ years} from the MGH Memory
Division and the I-CONECT Foundation. The cohort will consist of two
balanced groups: \textbf{20 individuals with mild cognitive impairment
(MCI)} and \textbf{20 cognitively normal (NC)} participants.

\textit{Inclusion criteria}: \noindent (1) Aged 75+; (2) Clinical diagnosis of MCI; (3) Identified as socially isolated by one of: (a) Score $\leq 12$ on the 6-item Lubben Social Network Scale (LSNS-6) \cite{lubben2006performance}; (b) Engages in conversations lasting 30 minutes or longer no more than twice per week, per participant self-report; (4) GDS-15 (15-item Geriatric Depression Scale) at/below 9 (not severely depressed) \cite{yesavage1982development}. (5) Answering "Often" to at least one question on the Hughes et al. Three-Item UCLA Loneliness Scale \cite{russell1978developing}. (6) Ability to understand the research consent form. (7) Cognitive status assessed using the Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status (TICS) \cite{fong2009telephone} should be MCI or NC, depending on the group.

\textit{Exclusion criteria}: \noindent (1) Diagnosed with dementia such as AD, ischemic vascular dementia, normal pressure hydrocephalus, or Parkinson's disease. (2) Schizophrenia or other major psychiatric disorder defined by DSM-IV criteria \cite{wilson1994special}. (3) Medications: frequent use of high doses of analgesics; use of sedative medications except for those used occasionally for sleep ($\leq2$ per week); unstable dosing of cholinesterase inhibitors (must be stable for 2 months).

\section{DATA PROCESSING AND ANALYSES}

\textbf{Aim 1}: We will use I-CONECT recorded conversations to evaluate
and optimize the chatbot design for better implementation of the
I-CONECT protocol.

\textbf{Method: Processing I-CONECT Data and Constructing Virtual Users.} We will use the existing I-CONECT audiovisual corpus of older
adult interviews (with and without mild cognitive impairment, MCI) to
design and optimize the AIMI-CONECT chatbot. All data will be processed on
HIPAA-compliant servers with identifiers removed.

The whole process include these steps:
(1) \textbf{Data preprocessing:} Audio will be transcribed using a
  speaker-aware ASR optimized for older adult speech, separating
  interviewer and participant utterances. Transcripts will be aligned
  with metadata, and quality checked manually and automatically.
(2) \textbf{Annotation and feature extraction:} We will extract
  conversational and linguistic features (e.g., word counts, lexical
  diversity, reminiscence markers) from transcripts. A subset will be
  manually annotated for reminiscence and cognitively demanding prompts.
(3) \textbf{Virtual user construction:} We will create LLM-based "virtual
  users" of older adult participants by fine-tuning models on aggregated
  participant data (not verbatim transcripts) to simulate their language
  patterns and engagement behaviors, reflecting differences between MCI
  and cognitively normal participants.
(4) \textbf{Simulation-based evaluation:} The virtual users will simulate
  \textbf{Simulation-based evaluation:} The virtual users will simulate
  large-scale conversations with the AIMI-CONECT chatbot, enabling
  low-cost testing and controlled experimentation by varying chatbot
  strategies.
(5) \textbf{Reward Modeling:} We will establish quantitative
  rewards based on the I-CONECT protocol, including: (i) \textit{Engagement:} Participant word ratio (participant words/total
    words). (ii) \textit{Reminiscence:} Reminiscence turn ratio (autobiographical turns/total participant turns). (iii) \textit{Vocabulary enhancement:} Lexical richness indices (e.g.,
    type--token ratio). (iv) \textit{Critical thinking:} Frequency of cognitively demanding prompts from the AI.
  All the turn type justification will be given by prompted LLMs\cite{zheng2023judging}.

% \textbf{Iterative optimization:} Simulation results will guide
% successive optimization cycles, revising chatbot parameters that fail to
% meet engagement or reminiscence thresholds. Only validated chatbot
% configurations will advance to human testing.

% Collectively, Aim 1 establishes a rigorous, data-driven method for
% translating the I-CONECT intervention protocol into a scalable, AI-based
% conversational system while minimizing risk prior to human deployment.

\textbf{Aim 2}: We will conduct a survey to evaluate the feasibility of using AI as an alternative to human-led delivery.

We will recruit a total of \textbf{40 socially isolated older adults
aged $\geq75$ years}, including \textbf{20 individuals with mild cognitive
impairment (MCI)} and \textbf{20 cognitively normal (NC)} participants.
This sample size is designed to support the \textbf{primary aims of
feasibility and user satisfaction}, rather than to test intervention
efficacy.

\textbf{(1) Adherence.} The primary feasibility outcome is
adherence to the intervention, defined at the participant level as
completion of \textbf{$\geq80\%$ of scheduled AIMI-CONECT sessions}. A total
sample size of \textbf{N=40} allows estimation of the overall adherence
proportion with adequate precision for feasibility assessment. For
example, assuming an expected adherence rate of approximately
\textbf{80\%}, N=40 yields a 95\% confidence interval with a half-width
of approximately \textbf{$\pm 12\%$}, which is sufficient to determine
whether adherence meets the predefined feasibility threshold. This level
of precision is appropriate for an R21 feasibility study and supports
clear \textbf{go/no-go decisions} for future scale-up.\\
Including \textbf{20 MCI and 20 NC participants} ensures that
feasibility can be assessed across two cognitively distinct but relevant
subpopulations. With \textbf{N=20 per group}, adherence rates can be
estimated separately for MCI and NC participants with acceptable
precision for feasibility purposes, allowing identification of
group-specific implementation challenges (e.g., differential session
completion, technology burden, or need for support) without powering the
study for between-group efficacy comparisons.

\textbf{(2) Acceptability} of the AIMI-CONECT
intervention will be evaluated using the Client Satisfaction
Questionnaire--8 (CSQ-8), a validated measure of user satisfaction for
health and behavioral interventions, with total scores ranging from 8 to
32 and higher scores indicating greater satisfaction.
\textbf{Acceptability will be defined a priori using explicit,
quantitative criteria}, such that the intervention will be considered
well accepted if the \textbf{mean CSQ-8 score is $\geq24$}, \textbf{at least
70\% of participants achieve CSQ-8 scores $\geq24$}, and \textbf{no more than
15\% of participants score $\leq20$}, indicating the absence of systematic
dissatisfaction. A total sample size of \textbf{N=40 (20 MCI and 20
cognitively normal participants)} is sufficient for this purpose because
it provides adequate precision to evaluate these criteria without
hypothesis testing. Specifically, if approximately 70\% of participants
meet the satisfaction threshold (CSQ-8 $\geq24$), a sample of 40 yields a
95\% confidence interval with a half-width of approximately
\textbf{$\pm 14\%$}, allowing us to distinguish between unacceptably low
satisfaction (e.g., $<55$--$60\%$) and satisfaction levels
consistent with good acceptability. Similarly, with N=40, the mean CSQ-8
score can be estimated with sufficient precision to determine whether it
exceeds the prespecified benchmark of 24, while also allowing assessment
of score variability and detection of potential ceiling or floor
effects. The allocation of \textbf{20 participants per cognitive
subgroup} further allows acceptability to be summarized separately for
MCI and cognitively normal older adults, enabling identification of
subgroup-specific usability or burden concerns.
This precision-based justification aligns with the feasibility and
acceptability aims of the study and supports clear go/no-go decisions
for refinement and future trials, consistent with the exploratory intent
of the R21 mechanism.

\textbf{Exploratory Outcomes.} Cognitive assessments will be collected for exploratory and descriptive purposes only. Additional survey will be collected to understand the participants' preferences for the different compoents in the system design, to inform the future design.
% Instead, these measures will be used to evaluate feasibility of
% remote assessment, completion rates, and data quality, and to generate
% preliminary signals to inform the design of future trials.

% In summary, a total sample size of \textbf{20 MCI and 20 NC
% participants} is well-suited to the goals of this R21 by providing
% sufficient precision to evaluate adherence-based feasibility and user
% satisfaction.

\section{POTENTIAL Risks AND ALTERNATIVE STRATEGIES}

The project
faces additional risks that are not fully resolved by the above approach,
with corresponding alternative strategies:
\textbf{(1) Poor infrastructure or environment conditions.} In real-world
home conditions (e.g., intermittent connectivity, background noise, device
microphone/speaker failures, or latency that disrupts turn-taking), usability and session completion could be reduced. As
alternatives, we will implement a more efficient conversation flow that can
operate with lower bandwidth (longer pause between turns allowing more time for caching data), provide
rapid device health checks and remote troubleshooting, and maintain spare
devices for swap-out.
\textbf{(2) Device malfunctioning}. Device could be lost, damaged, or malfunctioning during the study, which could lead to missing data and reduced adherence. As alternatives, we will maintain spare devices for swap-out, provide rapid remote troubleshooting, and implement regular device health checks to identify issues early.
\textbf{(3) LLM/API server downtime or rate limiting}. Dependence on third-party API services could lead to interruptions in chatbot availability due to server downtime or rate limiting, which could affect session completion and user experience. As alternatives, we will monitor API status continuously, implement caching strategies to handle temporary outages, and maintain a contingency plan to switch to alternative services or local models if necessary.
% \textbf{(4) Model and platform drift} during the project
% (e.g., changes in third-party model behavior, pricing, rate limits, or
% content policies) could cause regressions in protocol compliance,
% engagement, or latency. As alternatives, we will pin model versions when
% possible, maintain an automated regression test suite based on the virtual
% benchmarks, and keep a contingency path to switch to an alternative model
% or a smaller on-premise model for core dialogue behaviors if external
% dependencies become unstable.
% \textbf{(5) Reluctance to use an always-listening voice system} due to
% privacy perceptions (e.g., concerns about recording, surveillance, or data

% derived features when feasible rather than raw audio), and (iii) providing a

% The project
% faces four main risks with corresponding alternative strategies:
% \textbf{Risk 1} concerns the insufficient quality of I-CONECT audio data
% for ASR and LLM fine-tuning, which will be mitigated by employing
% advanced data augmentation and noise reduction, leveraging pre-trained
% domain-specific models, and shifting emphasis to extensive prompt
% engineering if necessary. 
% \textbf{Risk 2} addresses the challenge of low
% recruitment or poor adherence among older adults in the human survey
% (Aim 2), which will be countered by utilizing existing collaborations
% through the ADRC, simplifying the protocol (brief sessions,
% provided tablet), and employing staged recruitment with early feedback.
% \textbf{Risk 3} involves safety and trustworthiness concerns regarding
% the LLM\textquotesingle s potential to generate harmful or non-factual
% content, which will be managed through robust pre- and post-generation
% content filtering, implementing limited, privacy-preserving memory
% management, and integrating an in-app reporting mechanism for real-time
% feedback. Finally, \textbf{Risk 4} is the difficulty in achieving
% human-level conversational engagement, which will be addressed through
% iterative fine-tuning guided by virtual testing metrics like "Word
% Ratio" and digital twin satisfaction, post-survey algorithmic
% adjustments based on human feedback on empathy and stimulation, and
% potentially exploring a human-in-the-loop hybrid approach in future work
% if AI-only engagement proves insufficient.

\section{IMPACT}

Our team is highly interdisciplinary, comprising a
statistician, a neurologist, and multiple computer scientists in trial
design/analytics, all with extensive experience in AD research. This R21
is especially timely, addressing the growing demand for complementary
alternatives to traditional human-led interventions. If feasible and
successful, it will greatly increase the accessibility of early dementia
intervention for socially isolated older adults.
