\section{Project Summary/Abstract}
Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) are a growing public health burden, and social isolation is a modifiable risk factor for cognitive decline in older adults. Evidence from the Internet-based Conversational Engagement Clinical Trial (I-CONECT) shows that structured, frequent conversation can help, but delivery by trained staff is difficult to scale. This project will develop an artificial intelligence (AI) conversational system, AI-CONECT, to deliver the I-CONECT conversation guide with safe, consistent, and accessible sessions. The long-term objective is to provide a scalable, affordable approach that can reduce social isolation and support cognitive health. The specific aims are: (1) build a voice-first chatbot that follows the I-CONECT conversation flow, supports guided reminiscence and vocabulary practice, and includes safety monitoring for distress, misinformation, and financial risk; and (2) conduct a feasibility and satisfaction study with 40 socially isolated older adults age 75 years and older with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or normal cognition, using four 15-minute sessions per week for six weeks and brief weekly staff check-ins. We will assess adherence, engagement, usability, and satisfaction using use logs and surveys. Expected outcomes are a validated prototype, evidence of feasibility and user acceptance, and a clear path to larger studies. This work is relevant to public health because it targets a major risk factor for dementia with a scalable approach that can reach older adults who lack access to human-delivered programs.

\section{Project Narrative}
Dementia and cognitive decline impose a large public health burden, and social isolation increases risk in older adults. This project will create a safe, accessible artificial intelligence (AI) conversational system that provides structured social engagement at home for socially isolated older adults. The approach could expand access to preventive support for communities that cannot sustain frequent human-delivered programs.

\section{Resource Sharing Plan(s)}
\textbf{Model organisms:} Not applicable. This project does not develop model organisms.

\textbf{Research tools and materials:} We will share the AI-CONECT software components, conversation prompts, survey instruments, codebooks, and analysis scripts. Software will be released in a public code repository under an open license and archived with a persistent identifier. Materials will be shared no later than the time of the first related publication or the end of the project period, whichever comes first.

\textbf{Other resources:} No proprietary materials are expected. If any unique, non-proprietary resources are developed, they will be distributed to qualified investigators with standard data use and safety conditions.

\section{Data Sharing Plan}
This Data Management and Sharing (DMS) Plan describes how scientific data from this project will be managed, preserved, and shared.

\textbf{Data type:} We will generate conversation transcripts with names and direct identifiers removed, derived language and engagement measures, survey responses, and system use logs. Documentation will include study protocols, a table that explains each variable, and survey instruments. Raw audio will not be shared unless consent and privacy protections allow it.

\textbf{Related tools, software, and code:} Data processing and analysis scripts will be shared in the same public code repository as the project software, with clear instructions to reproduce reported results.

\textbf{Standards:} Tabular data will be provided in non-proprietary formats such as comma-separated values (CSV). Variable names, definitions, and allowed values will be documented in a table that explains each variable. Where applicable, we will use common measures and reporting formats used in aging and cognitive health research.

\textbf{Data preservation, access, and timelines:} Datasets and documentation will be deposited in a public repository that provides permanent identifiers and long-term preservation, such as an institutional repository or the Open Science Framework. Data will be shared no later than the time of an associated publication or the end of the project period, whichever comes first, and will remain available for at least five years after release.

\textbf{Access, distribution, or reuse considerations:} We will maximize appropriate sharing while protecting participant privacy and confidentiality. Data will be reviewed for the risk that someone could match the data back to a person. If any dataset includes sensitive variables that could increase this risk, access will be controlled through a data use agreement and review process. Use will be limited to research purposes consistent with consent and applicable regulations.

\textbf{Oversight of data management and sharing:} The Principal Investigator and a designated data manager will oversee compliance with this plan, review data sharing readiness before release, and conduct compliance checks at least every six months.
