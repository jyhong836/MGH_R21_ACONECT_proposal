## Project Rules
- When talking about the proposed project, avoid statement indicating clinical trials. For example, do not measure clinical outcomes, do not compare the pre-post effects. But if it is about other studies like I-CONECT, it is okay.
- The context should be coherent. 
- The context should be consistent. If the proposed method will consider safety in "Specific Aims", then the following sections should also discuss safety.

## Goals
- Write a proposal for NIH R21.

## Code Style
- Use LaTex.
- No jargon.
- Define every acronym before use.
