## Rationale for Assignment Suggestions (Optional; <=1000 characters)
This application develops and evaluates a multimodal conversational artificial intelligence (AI) system that adapts an evidence-based social interaction protocol for older adults with limited social interaction and with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or normal cognition. CIDH is appropriate because the project centers on cognitive health in aging and intervention development. CDBA is appropriate because the work emphasizes behavior-focused conversational engagement and feasibility in human participants. SPIP is appropriate because the project targets social interaction processes and scalable delivery of structured social engagement. The proposal also includes protocol fidelity and safety monitoring, which align with these review domains.
